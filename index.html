        <p>Hi!</p>

        <p>
          My name's Brooke, and I'm a third-year computer science student at
          Georgia Tech, pursuing concentrations in people and devices, as well
          as a sustainable cities minor. I'm interested in learning more about
          front-end development, UI/UX design, and the intersections of
          sustainability and computing.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm the director of outreach for the Georgia Tech
          <a href="experience-pages/sustainability-involvements.html"
            >Veggie Jackets</a
          >
          (our plant-based diet/lifestyle club) and an active member of Students
          Organizing for Sustainability/the Georgia Tech Community Garden.
          Additionally, I'm about to start my third semester as an
          <a href="experience-pages/teaching-assistant.html">
            undergraduate teaching assistant</a
          >
          for discrete math in the College of Computing. I am also working on a
          Seismic Catalog Declustering project for the
          <a href="experience-pages/extreme-events-engineering.html"
            >Extreme Events Engineering Vertically Integrated Project</a
          >
          under Dr. Jorge Macedo.
        </p>

        <p>
          During the summer of 2020, I remotely interned on the Custom Apps team
          doing UX and software engineering for
          <a href="experience-pages/cei-internship.html"
            >Computer Enterprises, Inc.</a
          >
          in Pittsburgh, PA. The following is a quote from Mike Pisino, the
          senior UX designer I worked with: “Her attention to detail was
          remarkable and her efficiency in doing both design and development
          were on par with some of the very best I have had the pleasure of
          working with over my career. Needless to say, I fully recommend and
          endorse Brooke to absolutely anyone in the software development
          industry. She is going to have an incredible career, one that I
          believe will be transformative to any company that is lucky enough to
          hire her.” (full recommendation can be found on my
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brooke-christiansen/"
            >LinkedIn page</a
          >)
        </p>

        <p>
          I just finished my summer software engineer internship at
          <a href="experience-pages/viasat-internship.html">Viasat</a>!
