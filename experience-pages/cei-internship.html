              I worked on a project called the Team Skills Matrix during my
              remote internship at Computer Enterprises, Inc. (CEI) during the
              summer of 2020. The aim of the project was to create an
              application that allowed employees to make profiles and filter an
              employee directory by skill, certification, location, etc. I did
              UX along with an intern with a digital design background and
              development with an intern with a computer science background.

              Though the project wasn’t completed by the time I left, I learned
              and grew so much. It was my first time really using version
              control software or working on a software project of such a scale,
              and I had never even heard of Angular or TypeScript when I
              started. By the end of my time at CEI, I felt confident in these
              technologies, and I would love to get the chance to use them
              again.
            </p>

            <p tabindex="1">
              If I could go back or work on this more, I would add some of the
              features we had to cut for the MVP, spend more time talking to our
              stakeholder, and spend less time trying to perfect parts of early
              iterations that ended up being changed later.
            </p>

            <p tabindex="1">
              In addition to working on this project, I completed several
              PluralSight courses during my time at CEI. Read more about them
