            <h2>Graeter's Case Study</h2>

            <p>
              I am currently going through the process of redesigning the
              Graeter's app. Graeter's is an ice cream shop/brand based in Ohio
              that my family frequents.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our local shop opened not long before I went away for college, and
              Atlanta doesn’t have any Graeter’s shops (though they do carry
              their products in a few grocery stores). When I got sent home
              early thanks to the pandemic, my mom and I decided to go for some
              \socially-distant Graeter’s. I opened up the Graeter’s app on my
              phone, which I had used to earn rewards a few times, but never
              really looked at. As I tried to figure out the process of ordering
              from the shop near me, I was confused.
            </p>

            <p>
              <em
                >What was the difference between curbside and pickup? Why did
                the word ‘pickup’ look like a really tiny button, but wasn’t
                clickable?
              </em>
            </p>

            <p>
              I decided to test myself by redesigning most of the app, fixing
              some of the problems I saw and adding some additional
              enhancements. I’m pretty familiar with the Starbucks app thanks to
              my 2+ years of working there, and I recently followed along with a
              <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9mhOBAbsuo&ab_channel=RobertBradford"
                >video</a
              >
              detailing the speed design of a coffee shop app, so I felt I could
              use this knowledge to my advantage.
            </p>

            <h3>Analysis of Current App</h3>
            <p>
              I started by screen recording myself going through most of the
              features of the app and pulling screenshots from times where I saw
              things that I particularly liked or disliked (mostly dislikes). I
              found a lot more things I would change from taking an analytical
              perspective than I had initially seen as a regular user. This
              could mean that not every change I make will be picked up on by
              the majority of users, but I think that trying to fix as many of
              the problems as I can would be a good way to learn about a variety
              of UI design techniques/subjects. My notes on each screen are
              shown in the image above.
            </p>

            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <img
              src="../images/Competitive Analysis.png"
              class="experience-page-picture"
              alt="Competitive Analysis of the Starbucks and Kung Fu tea apps"
            />

            <p>
              I decided to take a more in-depth look at the Graeter’s app
              compared to some other food apps I was familiar with, like the
              Starbucks and Kung Fu Tea apps. The Starbucks app is pretty
              streamlined and modern, with some fun touches like emojis and
              greetings depending on the time of day. The Kung Fu Tea app, on
              the other hand, is pretty maximalist with lots of bright colors
              and illustrations.
            </p>

            <h3>Personas</h3>
            <p>Here are some personas I created as part of my analysis:</p>
            <img
              src="../images/Personas.png"
              class="experience-page-picture"
              alt="3 personas (teenager with latest iPhone going on an ice cream date, father with couple-year-old phone getting ice cream for himself and his toddler, and grandparent getting ice cream for spouse using outdated cellphone) and their descriptions, goals, and problems with the current implemenation"
            />

            <h3>Pinpointing Goals of Change</h3>
            <p>
              My prior analysis allowed me to think about what I want to change
              and what I want to keep going into the wireframing process. Here
              are some changes I would like to see:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>• Make more intuitive</li>
              <li>• Fix ‘note an allergy’ button</li>
              <li>
                • Make rewards page more dynamic (and increase question mark
                icon size)
              </li>
              <li>
                • Make icons more consistent (see ‘more’ page vs. footer vs.
                question mark icon on rewards page)
              </li>
              <li>
                • Make selected highlight in footer look more traditional
                (currently looks grayed out)
              </li>
              <li>• Pickup vs. curbside distinction</li>
              <li>• Make bottom and top navigation bars more consistent</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Here are some things I'd like to preserve:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>• Classic feel (especially with fonts and color scheme)</li>
              <li>• Structure/flow of app</li>
              <li>• Layouts of most screens</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              I'm currently finishing up some low-fidelity prototypes of the
              screens I analyzed (see image above). Since I wanted to keep the
              structure/flow of the app pretty similar, I made my low-fidelity
              prototypes directly above the screenshots of the original app.
