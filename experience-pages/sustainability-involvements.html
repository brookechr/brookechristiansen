            <h3 tabindex="0">Veggie Jackets</h3>

            <p tabindex="0">
              I'm currently serving as president for the Georgia Tech Veggie
              Jackets (our plant-based diet/lifestyle club), which has around
              600 members in our GroupMe chat. My responsibilities include
              managing general and executive meetings, volunteer days, and
              communication with dining services.
            </p>

            <p tabindex="0">
              We hold 2+ events open to general members per week (1 general
              meeting, fundraiser, or activism event and 1 group lunch), are
              currently campaigning for a local business near campus to add
              vegan options to their menu, work with the Humane League on ‘fast
              actions’ like calling businesses to promote humane consumer
              options, and work to foster a community where anyone at Georgia
              Tech who is interested in reducing their animal product
              consumption feels supported.

            <p tabindex="0">
              My proudest individual achievement/project as president is
              probably the GA Veg Orgs Network, which has required reaching out
              to and organizing clubs with similar purposes to Veggie Jackets
              around Georgia. I have linked organizations from Georgia State
              University, Kennesaw State University, and Fort Valley State
              University, and am in the process of reaching out to other schools
              nearby. With this network, we plan to share our events and advice,
              hold joint events, and inspire students at our schools to shift
              toward a vegan lifestyle.
            </p>

            <p tabindex="0">
              I was formerly the outreach chair of Veggie Jackets, for which my
              responsibilities included planning meetings and volunteering
              events, advertising the club on
              <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gtveggiejackets/"
                >social media</a
              >, designing advertising materials, creating and maintaining
              consistent branding for the club, and reporting student concerns
              shared on social media to the school's dining providers.

            <h3 tabindex="0">The Humane League</h3>

            <p tabindex="0">
              I'm a trained volunteer for the Humane League, which is an
              organization that advocates for animal cruelty prevention,
              primarily for chickens, and works with Veggie Jackets to provide
              us with organizing resources and other guidance. My main form of
              participation is currently frequently doing actions on their

                >Fast Action Network</a
              >, such as emailing, calling, and filling out contact forms for
              companies to encourage them to adopt more humane policies.
            </p>

            <h3 tabindex="0">Work on Climate</h3>

            <p tabindex="0">
              <a href="http://workonclimate.org/">Work On Climate</a> is an
              organization that helps connect people interested in contribution
              to climate change solutions. During late 2020 and early 2021, I
              did some pro-bono software development for Work on Climate on
              their

                >Braintrust Slack bot</a
              >. I'm currently just a general member, regularly participating in
              things like climate justice workshops, food waste reduction
              challenges, networking conversations, etc.
            </p>

            <p tabindex="0">
              In December 2020, I contributed a blog post called

              to the Pangolin website, an opportunity which I found since the
              creator of the website is a
              <a href="http://workonclimate.org/">Work On Climate</a> member.
            </p>

            <p>
              I also was a software developer and graphic designer for the
              podcast
              <a href="cwaws.html">Conversations with a Wannabe Scientist</a>
              from Jan. 2021 to June 2021, which I also found since the podcast
              host is a
