            <h3>Veggie Jackets</h3>

            <p>
              I'm currently serving as the director of outreach for the Georgia
              Tech Veggie Jackets (our plant-based diet/lifestyle club), for
              which my responsibilities include planning meetings and
              volunteering events, advertising the club on social media,
              designing advertising materials, creating and maintaining
              consistent branding for the club, and reporting student concerns
              shared on social media to the school's dining providers.
            </p>

            <h3>The Humane League</h3>

            <p>
              I'm a trained volunteer for the Humane League, which is an
              organization that advocates for animal cruelty prevention,
              primarily for chickens and works with Veggie Jackets to provide us
              with organizing resources and other guidance. My main form of
              participation is currently completing tasks on their
              <a href="https://action.thehumaneleague.org/home/"
                >Fast Action Network</a
              >, such as emailing, calling, and leaving comments for companies
              to encourage them to adopt more humane policies.
            </p>

            <h3>Students Organizing for Sustainability</h3>

            <p>
              During the school year, I volunteer weekly with Georgia Tech
              Students Organizing for Sustainability in their Community Garden
              helping with weeding, planting, watering, composting, etc.
            </p>

            <h3>Work on Climate</h3>

            <p>
              Work on Climate is an organization that helps connect people
              interested in contribution to climate change solutions. During
              late 2020 and early 2021, I did some pro-bono software development
              for Work on Climate on their
              <a href="../experience-pages/braintrust.html"
                >Braintrust Slack bot</a
              >. I'm currently just a general member, regularly participating in
              things like climate justice workshops, food waste reduction
              challenges, networking conversations, etc.
            </p>

            <p>
              In December 2020, I contributed an blog post called
              <a
                href="https://pangolin.green/discover/impact/why-adopt-a-plant-based-diet/"
                >Why Adopt a Plant-Based Diet?</a
              > to the Pangolin website, an opportunity which I found since the
              creator of the website is a Work On Climate member.
