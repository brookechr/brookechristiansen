              In my 4th year at Georgia Tech, I served as president for Veggie
              Jackets (our club for anyone interested in reduced animal product
              consumption), which had around 660 members on our roster. My
              responsibilities included managing general and executive meetings,
              volunteer days, and communication with dining services and the
              other organizations we collaborated with.

              </li>
              <li>
                • Established relationships and held joint events with similar

              to climate change solutions. During late 2020 and early 2021, I
              did some pro-bono software development for Work on Climate on
