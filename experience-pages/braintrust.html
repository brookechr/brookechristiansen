              This project concerned a Slack bot that allows users of the

              Slack workspace of 5,000+ members to search terms and have their
              synonyms come up in the results, rather than just exact string
              matching. I contributed to this project from December 2020 to
              February 2021.
            </p>

            <p tabindex="1">
              I worked on the project voluntarily with a group of industry
              developers and an industry product manager. As the only student in
              the group, it was a valuable learning experience to work with such
              experienced and helpful people.
            </p>

            <p tabindex="1">
              We used Python, Airtable, Google App Engine, pytest, and GitHub
              for this project. I set up the AirTable for the definitions and
              synonyms, which are crowd-sourced. A lot of the other work that I
              did was in the form of pair programming over video calls.

              The following is a quote from Richard Kim, the product manager I
              worked with: “Brooke was the sort of person who just makes the
              team better—smart, full of ideas, perceptive and empathetic to the
              user, and emotionally intelligent. I thought she showed great
              judgment and was a practical problem-solver, in addition to being
              dependable, a good communicator, and ready to pitch in” (full
              recommendation can be found on my
