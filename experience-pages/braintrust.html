            <p>
              This project concerned a Slack bot that allows users of the
              <a href="https://workonclimate.org/" tabindex="1">
                Work on Climate</a

              Slack workspace of 4,000+ members to search terms and have their
              synonyms come up in the results, rather than just exact string
              matching. I've been contributing to this project from December
              2020 to February 2021.
            </p>

            <p>
              I worked on the project voluntarily with a group of industry
              developers and an industry product manager. As the only student in
              the group, it was been a valuable learning experience to work with
              such experienced and helpful people.
            </p>

            <p>
              We used Python, pytest, Airtable, Google App Engine, and GitHub
              for this project. I set up the AirTable for the definitions and
              synonyms, which are crowd-sourced. A lot of the other work that I
              did was in the form of pair programming over video calls.
            </p>

            <p>
              The following is a quote from Richard Kim, the product manager I
              worked with: “Brooke was the sort of person who just makes the
              team better—smart, full of ideas, perceptive and empathetic to the
              user, and emotionally intelligent. I thought she showed great
              judgment and was a practical problem-solver, in addition to being
              dependable, a good communicator, and ready to pitch in.” (full
              recommendation can be found on my

              >).
