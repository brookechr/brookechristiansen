            <p tabindex="1">
              I am going into my third and final semester of being involved in
              the Extreme Events Engineering Vertically Integrated Project (VIP)
              under Dr. Jorge Macedo.
            </p>

            <p tabindex="1">
              During my first semester, I was tasked with updating/fixing a
              legacy Python codebase that had gone untouched for 5 years that
              performed seismic catalog declustering calculations on a dataset
              of earthquakes using the Zaliapin and Ben-Zion method. With help
              from teammates (who were working on implementations of other
              declustering algorithms), I ended up adding some data
              visualizations shown below.
            </p>

            <p tabindex="1">
              Declustering, or classifying independent and dependent events and
              removing the dependent events from the catalog, may be useful for
              isolating independent events during seismic hazard assessment,
              development of clustered seismicity models, earthquake prediction
              research, or seismicity rate change estimation.
            </p>

            <p tabindex="1">
              During my second semester, I created a MATLAB implementation of
              the Zaliapin and Ben-Zion method with more complex visualizations
              and also started creating a MATLAB k-means declustering
              implementation. The clusters currently outputted by the k-means
              implementation do not correspond to those that should be detected.
              This may imply that the k-means method cannot detect the correct
              clusters, thus it is important that we evaluate other
              classification methods (i.e., Gaussian mixture models) in the
              future.

              Data visualizations from the MATLAB implementation of the Zaliapin
              and Ben-Zion method. See only the independent events in the
              'after' visualizations. The lefthand column presents the events in
              time and space (measured with latitude), while the middle column
              presents the events' nearest-neighbor distances as histograms and
              the righthand column presents the events on a heatmap in the
              Log(T) vs. Log(R) space. Note that between the before and after
              visualizations, in the lefthand column, the density of events
              generally decreases, in the middle column, the density of events
              that have a low nearest-neighbor distance to each other decreases,
              and in the righthand column of visualizations, the 2 clusters
              representing dependent events have been removed.
