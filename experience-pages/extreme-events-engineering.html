            <p>
              I am going into my third and final semester of being involved in
              this Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) under Dr. Jorge Macedo.
            </p>

            <p>
              During my first semester, I was tasked with updating/fixing a
              legacy Python codebase for performing seismic catalog declustering
              calculations on a dataset of earthquakes in South America using
              the Zaliapin and Ben-Zion method that had gone untouched for the
              past 5 years. I knew very little about earthquakes or the formulas
              associated with classifying them, but was working with someone who
              had geophysics experience (though not a software development
              background). With all that said, it was challenging and sometimes
              frustrating to work with. However, with a lot of patience and Googling, I was able to make it
              work and add some new visualization functionality.
            </p>

            <table>
              <tr>
                <td>
                  <img
                    tabindex="1"
                    src="../images/declustering-before.webp"
                    alt="A map of earthquakes in and around Peru before seismic catalog declustering was performed"
                    class="table-picture"
                  />
                  <figcaption>
                    A screenshot from my first semester of a plot of all
                    recorded earthquakes.
                  </figcaption>
                </td>
                <td>
                  <img
                    tabindex="1"
                    src="../images/declustering-after.webp"
                    alt="A map of earthquakes in and around Peru after seismic catalog declustering was performed (now with less earthquakes)"
                    class="table-picture"
                  />
                  <figcaption>
                    A screenshot from my first semester of a plot of earthquakes
                    after the non-mainshocks were removed.
                  </figcaption>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>
              During my second semester, I created a MATLAB implementation of
              the Zaliapin and Ben-Zion method with more complex visualizations
              and also started creating a MATLAB k-means declustering
              implementation.
