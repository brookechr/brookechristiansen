            <h2>Extreme Events Engineering VIP Project</h2>

            <p>
              I am going into my second semester of being involved in this
              Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) under Dr. Jorge Macedo. Last
              semester, I was tasked with updating/fixing a legacy codebase for
              performing seismic catalog declustering calculations on a dataset
              of earthquakes in and around Peru using the Zaliapin and Ben Zion
              method that had gone untouched for the past 5 years. I knew very
              little about earthquakes or the formulas associated with
              classifying them, but was working with someone who had geophysics
              experience (though not a software development background). With
              all that said, it was challenging and sometimes frustrating to
              work with. However, with a lot of patience, Googling, and asking
              friends for guidance, I was able to make it work and add some new
              visualization functionality. For this project, I used Python with
              Matplotlib and NumPy.
