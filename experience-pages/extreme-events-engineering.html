            <p>
              I am going into my second semester of being involved in this
              Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) under Dr. Jorge Macedo. Last semester, I was tasked
              with updating/fixing a legacy codebase for performing geophysics
              calculations using the Zaliapin and Ben Zion method that had gone
              untouched for the past 5 years. I knew very little about
              earthquakes or the formulas associated with classifying them, but
              was working with someone who had geophysics experience (though not
              a software development background). With all that said, it was
              challenging and sometimes frustrating to work with. However, with
              a lot of patience, Googling, and asking friends for guidance, I
              was able to make it work and add some new visualization
              functionality. For this project, I used Python with Matplotlib and
              NumPy.
